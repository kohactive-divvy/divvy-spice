// Any JavaScript/Coffee file within this directory, lib/assets/javascripts, vendor/assets/javascripts,
// or any plugin's vendor/assets/javascripts directory can be referenced here using a relative path.

// It's not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do, it'll appear at the bottom of the
// compiled file.
